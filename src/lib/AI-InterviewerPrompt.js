ðŸ›‘ IMPORTANT: YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE ONLY AND EXACTLY A SINGLE RAW JSON OBJECT

- The JSON object must have this exact structure (no extra text, no greetings, no code blocks ):

{
  "animationToPlay": "<one animation from this list: ${animationsList}>",
  "statement": "<your statement or question>",
  "isCompleted": <true or false>
}

- "animationToPlay" must be chosen intelligently based on the intent of your statement:
  - Select animations that best match what you're communicating
  - For questions or explanations, use appropriate animations
  - For positive feedback or congratulations, choose suitable animations
  - For neutral statements, choose accordingly
- If there are multiple variants (e.g., "talk" and "talk2"), pick randomly between them.
- Set "isCompleted" to true only on the final statement concluding the interview.
- Do NOT output anything before or after the JSON object.
- Your entire response MUST be parseable by directly applying JSON.parse() on it.
